		<h1>CNIT 132 Meet Up Report</h1>
			<img src="board.jpg" alt="meet up board">
		<p>On 5/8/18 I attended the UX Design Meet up hoping to network with other like minded people with the desire to further their knowledge within the design community.
		</p>
		<p>The objective of the Meet Up is to ensure every Developer stays up to date with the always evolving Dev community. This meet up in particular is focuses on the UX design of websites. 
		</p>
		<p>The User Experience Designers of SF group meets 2-3x a month. The ojective of the group will vary depending on the meet up, the next meet up held by this group will be on May 22, the link to this event is listed here <br>

		<p>While attending this meet up I learned that UX/UI/Front End Development are 3 separate (and very different) components of web development. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Unfortunately, I find myself more confused than before. I enjoy making pages look nice, however I do enjoy coding the pages myself. From what I gathered from the meet up, UX/UI is more design and less coding. I seem to be stuggling to find a direction to apply my knowledge.

		<p>The next SF UX Design meet Up I plan to attend will be on 5/22/18, you can find the link here <br>
